# Matplotlib

With this project we will be determining certain statisics with Matplotlib

This progam is for Pymaceuticals Inc. which wants to run some statisics based on there anti-cancer pharmaceuticasl

This is looking at data for a pacfic type of cancer called Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) also known as skin cancer.

With the most recent animal study which consisted of 249 mice that have a SCC tumor on different drug regimens. This study was taken over 45 days and all observations and measures were taken on the tumors.

This report will be comparing the drug Capomulin vs other treatment regimens given to the mice.

The statics requested are as follos
    Summary table of the 
        mean
        median
        variance
        standard deviation
        SEM of the tumor volumn
    Generate the following graphs
        Bar Graph
        Pie Graph
    Calculate the volumn of the tumor for all regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin)
        Calculate quartiles
        IQR
    Then with the final volumn generate a whisker plot of the four regimens listed above.
    
    Create a line plot of a mouse who was treated with Capomulin with a timeline of tumor volume.
    
    Scatter plot of mouse weight vs tumor volume with Capomulin treatment
    
    Calculate the coorelation coefficient and linear regression model for the data above
    
    Three observalbles of this data
    1.Capomulin based on the mean, median, var, std had the lowest amounts of tumor volume but that could also be due to the fact that they had more mice then the others.
    2. They also had a higher ratio of female mice to male mice while the others were more even
    3. The tumor volumn did shrink more quickly on Capomulin based on timepoint and volume
